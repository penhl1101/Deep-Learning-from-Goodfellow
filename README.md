Visualization and code demonstration from the book "Deep Learning" by Ian GoodFellow.
Some simple codes and graphs which illustrate better about the concepts and ideas from Ian GoodFellow.

Why do I build this?
Because I found that pure maths and symbols are very hard to understand in the book. Developing real codes and examples better illustrate the idea.

Who should read this?
Anyone who is dedicated to learn Deep Learning. This will be the fundamentals for deep learning.

What if the content is not clear?
You can propose changes by creating pull requests. I will read it and review it. If you are enthusiastic about this project, you can always requests to be one of the collaborators!

My background:
I am a year 3 student studying in finance and stats. So the coding may not be clear and well demonstrated. But I am open for any collaboration and assistance.

How to use this repo:
I strongly recommend you to buy the book "Deep Learning" from Ian GoodFellow first. If you are confused by the contents, you could check our codes and visualization.

Thank you everyone for reading this! I hope you have a great "Deep Learning" journey!
